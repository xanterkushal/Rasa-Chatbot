# Rasa-Chatbot
I have made this chatbot using RASA framework and it will be used in college website for addressing the queries of people who want to know more about college.

First you have to create a database. I have made the database (my_rasa} in MYSQL and then I used the actions.py file to connect it with
then you should also normalize the data in the database. For example the contents of course_name and course_type in my database is in lowercase with no special characters.\
By this way when you are taking the query from user so first you have to match the query entities with the data you have in your database
